Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS term
Rule 2     expression -> expression MINUS term
Rule 3     expression -> term
Rule 4     term -> factor
Rule 5     factor -> NUMBER
Rule 6     factor -> LPAREN expression RPAREN

Terminals, with rules where they appear

LPAREN               : 6
MINUS                : 2
NUMBER               : 5
PLUS                 : 1
RPAREN               : 6
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 2 6 0
factor               : 4
term                 : 1 2 3

Parsing method: LALR
